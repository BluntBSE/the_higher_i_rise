NEXT UP:
	Fade in and out of text
	Populate aspects
	Make sure options can be revealed with the appropriate aspects
	Create a fixed data type for Interactions so we don't run into future issues
	Modify background color based on aspects
	

NOTES:
	
	You hardly use state.exit(), could be good for animating transitions when we get there.
