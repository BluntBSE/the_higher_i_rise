	BUG(?): Debug message sometimes shows that portraits aren't being found...even though they are fading?

	With individual words, in the refresh memory state, you use a combination of both relative and global position. Let's not?

	Make sure options can be revealed with the appropriate aspects
	Create a fixed data type for Interactions so we don't run into future issues - Maybe not?
	Modify background color based on aspects
