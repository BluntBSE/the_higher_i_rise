NEXT UP:
	BUG(?): Debug message sometimes shows that portraits aren't being found...even though they are fading?
	BUG: Sometimes the interaction doesn't load or doesn't fade in properly??? Possible lerp issue
	BUG: After hovering a word, something goes awry with the words added to the word inventory...
	BUG(?): Get to the bottom of that image load debuggger image thing.
	With individual words, in the refresh memory state, you use a combination of both relative and global position. Let's not?
	FIX YOUR LERPS: Your fade lerp is goofed. You check for it being finished. You actually need to increment it to 1.0 with delta. Weight is actually "portion complete"
	Make sure options can be revealed with the appropriate aspects
	Create a fixed data type for Interactions so we don't run into future issues - Maybe not?
	Modify background color based on aspects
	

NOTES:
	
	You hardly use state.exit(), could be good for animating transitions when we get there.
