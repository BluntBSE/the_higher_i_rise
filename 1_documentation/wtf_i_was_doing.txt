NEXT UP:
	Saving the game, loading the game. Main menu screen.
	
	(Done?) Configure for diff resolutions
	(Done?)Configure for macs -- Why don't the aspects work right?
	Make options available based on aspects

	
	With individual words, in the refresh memory state, you use a combination of both relative and global position. Let's not?
	FIX YOUR LERPS: Your fade lerp is goofed. You check for it being finished. You actually need to increment it to 1.0 with delta. Weight is actually "portion complete"
	Make sure options can be revealed with the appropriate aspects
	Create a fixed data type for Interactions so we don't run into future issues - Maybe not?
	Modify background color based on aspects
	

NOTES:
	WHEN YOU'RE FINALLY DONE: using find_child() is inefficient, and you should probably do something different
	You hardly use state.exit(), could be good for animating transitions when we get there.
	
	Font size 36 is a good one for modest emphasis.
