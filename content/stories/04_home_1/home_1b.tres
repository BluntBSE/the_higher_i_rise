text = "You feel better now, but you still have a nagging sense that something might be wrong. People don't usually black out for no reason, and when they do they don't usually suture someone shut like an expert.

You dig through a dozen other maladies that might be responsible, and you even look into cases of spontaneous savantism. People have been reported to develop new talents suddenly in life, but usually after suffering some kind of trauma.

If that was you, and you have the talent, where's the damage?

You wind up with nothing but a list of a dozen illnesses that might cause you to feel the way you do."
