text = "Looking up patients on the internet isn't usually a good idea for nurses, but some impulse leads you to look up Gabriel Wright. Maybe you just want to know that he'll be okay after he's discharged.

Unfortunately, what you find doesn't put your mind at ease. Gabe shows up in the news a few times. Once, for his involvement in a robbery. Later, as a witness in a drug trafficking case, and later still as an interviewee for a reporter covering Boston's overstressed resources for the homeless.

His social media feeds suggest he's not homeless anymore, but clips of him partying reveal a sort of frenetic, high-strung energy that just makes you worry more. You hope he's getting it together and you just can't see it.
