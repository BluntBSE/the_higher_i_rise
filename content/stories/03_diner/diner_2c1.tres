[KRISTIN]: I know art isn't everyone's thing, and I know I should feel lucky that I'm in a gallery at all. Last year I thought that would mean I really \"made it,\" you know?

[KRISTIN]: It's just like: If I'm making sculptures in my house and nobody sees it, that's what you expect. When you put them out there to be seen and nobody comes? That's hard.
