text = "You take a seat alongside a vintage, clawfoot tub and a real marble sink. Then, you open the book dead in the center, and begin to read from \"The Velletri Interviews.\"

Instead of paragraphs, you discover a line-by-line transcription between one \"Inspector Lacombe\" and one \"Inspector Bolt.\"  It is difficult to follow without context, but they seem like cops, and this appears to be an interrogation. Inspector Bolt seems to be accusing Inspector Bolt of robbery, or something similar, and demands details on this crime with mounting agitation.

Inspector Lacombe, meanwhile, seems barely-lucid, and very angry when he manages to be on topic. One exchange in particular catches your eye.
