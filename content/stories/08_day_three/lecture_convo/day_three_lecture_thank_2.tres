[ANSIN]: But consider yourself fortunate. Most people live and die without learning any of this. And if you are interested in learning more about these things, some friends and I gather here at my house every week to share our latest discoveries.

[ANSIN]: I'm sure everyone would love to meet a natural talent. I'll text you when we next meet. I hope you will join us.
