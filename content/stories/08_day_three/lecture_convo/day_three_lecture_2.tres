text = "[ANSIN]: Presiding over the House are the Hours. As a shorthand, you may think of them as gods. If you stick with us you will see why that is not accurate, but that isn't relevant for today.

[ANSIN]: What [i]is[/i] relevant is that the House exists outside of time as you know it. Make no mistake, time is real, but it's like... Have you ever seen a rope flail? Like the kind used by flagellant monks? On one side of the flail you have the cords, which lead away from the handle. These are like History, which extends into the past in a thousand different directions.

[ANSIN]: On the other side of the flail is the handle, where the cords of the flail wrap around each other and become one. This is like Eternity. The future, if you will.
