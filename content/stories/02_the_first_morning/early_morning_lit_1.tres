text = "The best cure for a bad dream, you decide, is a [i]good[/i] one. You brew your morning coffee, you warm up a scone in the microwave, and soon you lose yourself in the pages of [i]Shot in the Dark[/i], a steamy noir mystery that follows two spies on opposite sides of the Cold War. 

Billionaire oligarchs are silenced in the dead of night.

Vows of vengeance are taken.

A treasonous love affair blooms between our spies as a pair of garters is slowly, tantalizingly, checked for weapons.

You're interested primarily in the plot, of course.
