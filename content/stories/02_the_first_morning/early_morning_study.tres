text = "Yesterday, a patient at your hospital presented with a litany of digestive issues. The doctor's diagnosis was inconclusive, but one detail stuck out to you, the attending nurse: the woman claimed a total inability to burp. 

You spend your free time this morning browsing the internet for similar cases, and soon you're going down the rabbit-hole of [i]retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction[/i]. You learn about the systemic pathology of people who can't burp, and learn about the exotic botox procedures being developed to fix it.

You're not a doctor yet, but you might be able to use this to get one to reconsider his diagnosis. With any luck, someone's life will improve from this.
