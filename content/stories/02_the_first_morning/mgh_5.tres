[KRISTIN] \"New Greek breakfast spot just opened up. Four point four stars already. Text me when you get off!\"

She's gone before you can respond.

Kristin's mostly motivated by her stomach, but the options for late-night nurses are few and far between, so she's always hunting for new spots for the team. Somehow, you've become her de-facto deputy in this quest."
