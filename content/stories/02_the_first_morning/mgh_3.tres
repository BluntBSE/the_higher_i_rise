He motions for you to step behind the desk and, after looking both ways, conspiratorially opens one of this desk drawers. Stan's stash of donuts and canned coffee drinks is an open secret, a card played whenever Stan, as Charge Nurse of the night shift,  imagines his team insufficiently motivated. He insists that you stuff your bag with treats before allowing you to check in for your shift.

[MR. GLADMAN]: \"You're not saving anybody's life if you fall asleep.  Sort yourself out. Check your face. Then check in on this patient for me.\"
