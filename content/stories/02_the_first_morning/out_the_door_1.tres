He motions for you to step behind the desk and, after looking both ways, conspiratorially pulls a drawer out from his desk. Stan's stash of donuts and canned coffee drinks is an open secret, a card played whenever Stan, as Charge Nurse of the night shift, felt his team required additional motivation, and now he motions you towards it. He insists that you stuff your bag with treats before allowing you to check in for your shift.

[MR. GLADMAN]: \"You're not saving anybody's life if you fall asleep.  Sort yourself out. Check your face. Then check in on this patient for me.\"

He slides you a clipboard full of papers and shoos you away."
