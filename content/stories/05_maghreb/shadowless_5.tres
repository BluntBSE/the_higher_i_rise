text = "You spend the next few minutes hastily describing what you saw in Vienna: a small room crowded with records, rented by an unshaven adept who summoned you for a thousand tiresome chores. You did not care about his goals, but one day you spied one of his notes:

\"Lady K. Green Chalcedony. Three-lobed. Spring leaves...\"

A description of a key to the Mansus. You started paying attention.

In time you learned of his plan. It was crude, in the way the plans of powerful men often are. Instead of asking for Frau Schlüssel's blessing to open the Mansus — or anyone's, for that matter — he would kidnap her precious dog at the groomer's and demand the Chalcedony Key for ransom."
