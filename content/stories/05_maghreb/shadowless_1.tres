text = "In this history, the summit is surrounded by a perfect circle of enormous mirrors that seem to channel and multiply the light of the sun, focusing it into a single point in the center. If you still had a body you would be blinded immediately, or perhaps even cooked to death, but in your incorporeal form you can appreciate the purity of this place.

There are no embellishments. The floor has been leveled and polished so as to be devoid of shadow. There is only the sky, the sun, and this intensity of radiance.

There is also the serpent.
