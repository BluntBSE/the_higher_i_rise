[GABE]: I brought you a treat! I mean, uh, I brought you an offering! It's good stuff. Really top-shelf. Come here.

Gabe opens the flask and begins to pour it out right into the corner where the wall meets the ground, where it vanishes.

You're high. You [i]know[/i] you're high. But you also know for a fact that there's no splash. No vodka pools on the floor. It just leaves Gabe's flask and is deleted from this world.
