[GABE]: I just wanted to tell you: I saw something on my way in you might want to see too.

[GABE]: This place is cool and all, but I'm pretty bad at dancing, and, uh, this could be a little more interesting.

[GABE]: Ansin hates it when I fuck with magic stuff in public, but if you're one of us maybe it's good for you to see some of it for yourself.

[GABE]: Without any \"adult supervision.\"

Ansin, you realize, is nowhere to be seen."
