text = "Gabe holds his lighter under the end of his pipe and you hear something begin to crackle inside the glass. Then he takes a long drag and holds it, and after what feels like an eternity, he exhales. A plasticky smell fills the lot.

A moment later he holds the pipe up to your lips and, following his instructions, you take a deep breath. The smoke doesn't irritate your lungs like you expect it to, but when you exhale it leaves a nasty, chemical taste in your mouth that makes you wonder if this was a good idea.
