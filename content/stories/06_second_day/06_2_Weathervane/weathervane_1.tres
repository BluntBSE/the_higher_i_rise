You follow his eyes but can't tell what he's looking at. The shadows on the wall are moving, but that's hardly surprising with the bugs circling the light.

When you look back at him, Gabe is suddenly holding a glass pipe and a lighter. 

[GABE]: So what we're gonna do is we're gonna smoke a little bit of this, and then we'll be able to talk to him. I'll go first because I can handle it, but we should really do it at the same time.
