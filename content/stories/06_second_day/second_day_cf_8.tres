But then you see it. There's the sun at the horizon, filling the Charles River with pink light. There's the rooftop birds, nestled in the warmth of the air conditioners. Their song is muffled by the heavy glass window, but in the quiet of the hospital floor, it's also the only thing you hear. You could listen to it this way — gently, like a guest — or you could push your ear to the glass and eavesdrop.

The birds won't care either way. The birds are untouchable. And to a person trapped in a hospital, isn't that beautiful?

You've never listened to the birds on the roof, but maybe, in another history, you did."
